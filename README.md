G2 Operating System
=

This is a simple OS infrastructure for embedded devices with no Memory Management Unit (MMU).

The main goal of this project is to provide a OS environment for embedded designs with mininal 
overhead. Furthermore, this project targetted for STM32F0 devices may be ported with minimal effort
to other ARM Cortex-M devices, or even further (AVR, MSP430 and so on).
